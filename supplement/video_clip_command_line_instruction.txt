video clip function as a command line instruction
Format is:
          "source"             -ss "start time"  -t "duration to stop time"  "destination"

timea are in seconds

ffmpeg -i "Videos/2D_vis_demo-1.mp4" -ss "22" -t "91" "Videos/2D_demo_clip.mp4"

Concatenate 3 clips:

Create a test file with the names of the clips:

file '3D_clip1.mp4'
file '3D_clip2.mp4'
file '3D_clip3.mp4'

Name the text file something like input.txt then run the following from the directory where the clips and text file are located

ffmpeg -f concat -i input.txt -c copy output.mp4


speed up a video:

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter:v "setpts=0.5*PTS" -an output.mp4

Here is a breakdown of the various parameters:

    -i input.mp4: Specifies the input video file that FFmpeg will process. Replace input.mp4 with the name of your video file.
    -filter:v: Applies a video filter to the input video stream.
    setpts=0.5PTS: It reduces the PTS by half (0.5), which makes the output video play twice as fast as the original video.
     You can adjust the figure to suit your use case. For example, using 0.25PTS will make the output video play four times faster.
    -an: The -an stands for “audio none” and it disables the audio stream in the output file.
