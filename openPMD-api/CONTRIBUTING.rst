Contribution Guide
==================

GitHub
------

The best starting point is the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-api/issues>`_.

For existing tasks, the labels `good first issue <https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_ and `help wanted <https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-api/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22>`_ are great for contributions.
In case you want to start working on one of those, just *comment* in it first so no work is duplicated.

New contributions in form of `pull requests <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`_ always need to go in the ``dev`` (development) branch.

Maintainers organize prioritites and progress in the `projects tab <https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-api/projects>`_.

Style Guide
